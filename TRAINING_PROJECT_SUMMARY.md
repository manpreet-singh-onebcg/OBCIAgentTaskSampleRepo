## 🚨 Intentional Issues Introduced

### 🔒 Security Vulnerabilities (25+ issues)
- **Hardcoded credentials** in multiple files
- **SQL injection** vulnerabilities
- **Weak cryptography** (MD5 hashing, hardcoded keys)
- **Information disclosure** through logs and responses
- **Authentication bypass** opportunities
- **Insecure direct object references**

### ⚡ Performance Problems (20+ issues)
- **String concatenation in loops** causing O(n²) complexity
- **N+1 database query patterns**
- **Blocking async operations** (.Result calls, Thread.Sleep)
- **Memory leaks** from undisposed resources
- **Inefficient collection operations**
- **Unnecessary object allocations**

### 🧹 Code Quality Issues (30+ issues)
- **High cognitive complexity** (deeply nested conditions)
- **Methods with too many parameters** (8+ parameters)
- **Dead code** and unused methods
- **Poor naming conventions**
- **Static mutable state** causing thread safety issues
- **Empty catch blocks** swallowing exceptions

### 🏗️ Architectural Problems (15+ issues)
- **God classes** with multiple responsibilities
- **Missing abstractions** and proper separation of concerns
- **Thread-unsafe singleton patterns**
- **Resource management** violations
- **Improper exception handling** patterns

## 📁 Key Files with Issues

### 🎯 Primary Training Files
1. **TaskService.cs** - Application layer service (15+ issues)
2. **TasksController.cs** - API controller (12+ issues)
3. **TaskRepository.cs** - Data access (10+ issues)

### 🎯 Advanced Training Files
4. **TaskHelperService.cs** - Utility service (20+ issues)
5. **SecurityHelper.cs** - Security utilities (15+ issues)
6. **LegacyDataAccess.cs** - Legacy data access (18+ issues)
7. **ProblematicUtilities.cs** - General utilities (12+ issues)

## 🎓 Training Objectives

### Level 1: Code Review & Quality Improvement
