## üîß TaskController.cs ‚Äì AI-Assisted Refactoring Log

### üìå Prompts Used

**Prompt 1:**  
Analyze the TasksController.cs class for code quality and maintainability. Identify areas where complexity can be reduced and suggest improvements to enhance structure and overall code quality.

**Prompt 2:**  
Refactor the above identified issues in the TasksController.cs using best practices for performance, security, and code quality. Apply secure coding standards and optimized patterns to improve maintainability and reduce potential vulnerabilities.

**Prompt 3:**  
Review the provided code and fix the following issues while aligning with original logic and best practices:

Bug fix: User ID should be retrieved from the request DTO, not ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier.  
Build error: Implement newly added methods declared in ITaskService.cs inside TaskService.cs.  
Bug fix: Ensure file upload name and path match the original implementation.  
Configuration: Use the maxFileSize setting from appsettings.json in the file upload logic.  
Response mismatch: Revert CreatedAtAction to use nameof(GetAll) with appropriate route values as in the original code.  
Ensure the final code maintains accuracy, security, and clarity, and respects the original design intent.  
Review the implementations of GetUserReport, SearchTasks, and SearchTasksAdvanced. Do not modify their business logic. Only refactor the code to improve performance, reduce complexity, and enhance security while preserving the original functional behavior.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges & Incorrect Output Generated

- JWT authentication was added unnecessarily, even though it was not part of the original prompt.  
- User ID was incorrectly fetched from ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier instead of the request DTO, as done in the original implementation.  
- Build issues present: new methods were added in ITaskService.cs, but corresponding implementations were missing in TaskService.cs.  
- The uploaded file name and file path were altered from the original code.  
- A max file size configuration was added to appsettings.json but was never utilized in the code.  
- The response in the original code used CreatedAtAction(nameof(GetAll), new { id }, id);, but the new code incorrectly replaced it with CreatedAtAction(nameof(GetById), ...).  
- The business logic of GetUserReport, ClearCache and SearchTasks methods was entirely changed instead of being optimized.

## üõ†Ô∏è TaskService.cs ‚Äì AI-Assisted Refactoring Log

### üìå Prompts Used

**Prompt 1:**  
Please analyze the TasksController.cs class for code quality, security, and maintainability. Your review should cover the following key aspects:  
Security Risks:  
Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities, especially in areas where raw SQL or dynamic queries are used.  
Ensure there are no hardcoded credentials, secrets, or sensitive configuration values.  
Performance Issues:  
Identify any N+1 query patterns caused by improper use of lazy loading or missing .Include() statements in database queries.  
Detect potential memory leaks due to undisposed resources (e.g., DbContext, file streams, or HttpClient instances not wrapped in using blocks).  
Code Quality and Maintainability:  
Highlight any methods with high cognitive complexity and suggest how they can be simplified (e.g., breaking into smaller methods, reducing branching).  
Point out any dead code, unused variables, or redundant logic that can be safely removed.  
Ensure that naming conventions are consistent and follow C# best practices for classes, methods, parameters, and variables.

**Prompt 2:**  
Please refactor the TaskService.cs class by implementing the improvements and fixes based on the previous analysis.

**Prompt 3:**  
Please review and revert any unnecessary changes made to the ReasonableLength. Ensure that the ReasonableLength constant or configuration value matches the original implementation.  
Restore the original structure of the isValidLength condition

**Prompt 4:**  
Revert changes made to the ValidateAdminAccess method ‚Äî its original business logic must remain unchanged.  
Restore the original _timer functionality ‚Äî only the required exceptions should have been fixed without altering its behavior.  
Fix the build issues introduced due to incomplete or inconsistent code changes.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges and wrong code:
- The ReasonableLength value was modified from the original code without justification, which could affect validation behavior.  
- The condition var isValidLength = result.Length <= ReasonableLength; was altered or restructured in a way that may impact the original logic. This change should not have been made.  
- The ValidateAdminAccess method‚Äôs business logic was changed, which violates the requirement to preserve its original behavior.  
- The _timer functionality was altered instead of preserving the original behavior. The expectation was to fix only the required exceptions without changing its business logic.  
- The code introduced build issues, indicating incomplete or inconsistent changes that prevent successful compilation.

## üóÑÔ∏è TaskRepository.cs ‚Äì AI-Assisted Refactoring Log

### üìå Prompts Used

**Prompt 1:**  
Analyze and optimize the TaskRepository with a focus on improving performance, security, and best practices. Specifically:  
Eliminate any SQL Injection vulnerabilities by ensuring all database interactions use parameterized queries or ORM-safe methods.  
Replace any synchronous method calls within async contexts to avoid thread blocking and improve scalability.  
Identify and fix any N+1 query patterns by optimizing database access with proper joins or eager loading.  
Investigate and resolve performance bottlenecks or inefficient logic present in the code.  
Review logging statements to prevent information disclosure ‚Äî sensitive or internal details should not be exposed in application logs.

**Prompt 2:**  
Please update the code with the following corrections and improvements:  
Fix the log message formatting ‚Äî use proper string concatenation or structured logging instead of altering the original message incorrectly.  
In the GetAllAsync() method, implement pagination by fetching the first 25 records by default. The page size value (25) should be configurable and read from appsettings.json.  
In the GetTasksByUserIdAsync() method, preserve the original business logic. Do not rewrite or change the core behavior ‚Äî instead, use FromSqlRaw to retrieve records as per the original implementation.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges and wrong code
- The log message was altered incorrectly instead of fixing the string concatenation issue.  
- Pagination logic was missing or not implemented in the GetAllAsync() method.  
- The original business logic of the GetTasksByUserIdAsync() method was changed, which should have been preserved.

## üß± LegacyDataAccess.cs ‚Äì AI-Assisted Refactoring Log

### üìå Prompt

Analyze and optimize the LegacyDataAccess class with a focus on improving its security, maintainability, and design quality. Specifically:  
Remove any hardcoded connection strings and replace them with secure configuration-based access (e.g., from appsettings.json or environment variables).  
Improve the design structure by refactoring tightly coupled logic and promoting separation of concerns where applicable.  
Eliminate the use of anti-patterns (e.g., redundant try-catch blocks, nested transactions, or static dependency usage).  
Ensure proper connection management by disposing of connections and commands correctly using -using blocks or dependency injection.  
Add necessary checks for transaction state validation before committing or rolling back to prevent runtime exceptions or inconsistent behavior.

## üîê SecurityHelper.cs ‚Äì AI-Assisted Refactoring Log

### üìå Prompt 1

Refactor the SecurityHelper.cs class to address the following critical security and code quality concerns:  
Remove hardcoded encryption keys ‚Äî move keys to secure configuration sources  
Replace the obsolete and weak MD5 algorithm with a modern, secure hashing algorithm like SHA-256 .  
Optimize inefficient string building by using StringBuilder for repetitive concatenation operations.  
Refactor encryption methods to eliminate hardcoded keys and improve the overall cryptographic implementation using standard, secure practices (e.g., AES with random IV and secure key storage).  
Fix insecure token generation logic ‚Äî use cryptographically secure random number generators (e.g., RNGCryptoServiceProvider or RandomNumberGenerator).  
Remove or secure any method that exposes sensitive information to prevent data leakage in logs or responses.  
Eliminate simulated SQL injection vulnerabilities by sanitizing inputs and ensuring no raw SQL execution with untrusted data.

### üêû Bugs

1. The EncryptionKey configuration setting is used in code but was not added to the appsettings.json configuration file.  
2. The ResetUserPassword method is missing the SQL query to update the user‚Äôs password, which was present in the original implementation.

### üîß Fixes Applied

- Add the EncryptionKey to the appsettings.json file. Access it securely through configuration injection to follow best security practices.  
- In the ResetUserPassword method, reintroduce the missing SQL query to update the user‚Äôs password. Ensure it aligns with the logic from the original implementation and uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
