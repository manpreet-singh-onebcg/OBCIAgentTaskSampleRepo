# 🎯 Agentic - Copilot Training Project

## 🚨 **Training Environment Notice**

This project contains **intentional code quality, security, and performance issues** designed for GitHub Copilot training. The code builds successfully but includes 70+ documented issues for educational purposes.

## 🎯 Project Objective

Use GitHub Copilot to identify, analyze, and fix code quality issues in a .NET 8 Web API that manages task assignments for both Human Users and AI Agents. This is a hands-on training environment for learning AI-assisted code review and improvement.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **Prerequisites**
- VS Code with C# extension
- .NET 8 SDK
- GitHub Copilot subscription
- SQL Server (LocalDB is fine)

### **Setup Instructions**
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd AgenticTaskManager
   ```

2. **Build the solution** (expect warnings, no errors)
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

3. **Run the API**
   ```bash
   cd AgenticTaskManager.API
   dotnet run
   ```

4. **Open Swagger UI**
   - Navigate to `https://localhost:7001/swagger`
   - Explore the API endpoints

---

## 🎯 Training Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Security Review**
```csharp
// Prompt Copilot: "Review this class for security vulnerabilities"
// Focus on: SecurityHelper.cs, LegacyDataAccess.cs
```

### **Scenario 2: Performance Analysis** 
```csharp
// Prompt Copilot: "Identify performance issues in this code"
// Focus on: TaskService.cs, TaskRepository.cs
```

### **Scenario 3: Code Quality Improvement**
```csharp
// Prompt Copilot: "Suggest refactoring to reduce complexity"
// Focus on: TaskHelperService.cs, ProblematicUtilities.cs
```

### **Scenario 4: Unit Testing with Copilot**
```csharp
// Prompt Copilot: "Generate unit tests for this class"
// Prompt Copilot: "Create test cases for edge cases and error scenarios"
// Prompt Copilot: "Write integration tests for the API endpoints"
// Focus on: Testing the fixed code after improvements
```
